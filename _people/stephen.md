## About Professor Strenn:
I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Santa Barbara City College. Since starting to work with the college in 2000, I have developed a wide range of cutting-edge courses including:  
  
* Software Design Patterns
* Android Programming
* Java Server Programming
* ASP.NET programming
* Software Engineering
* Programming for Engineers

My current research interests include mobile device programming, evolutionary computation, and software engineering.

Prior to joining the college, I worked for 10 years in the infrared detector industry as an electrical engineer at the Santa Barbara Research Center, and conducted robotics research as an engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. I received my Master's Degree in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu) from the [University of California at Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu).

I have previously published in the areas of evolutionary computation, Java enterprise programming, software design patterns, software engineering, Eclipse and the SWT, ASP.NET, artifical intelligence, and robotics. In 2005, I was a speaker at the IASTED Artificial Intelligence and Applications Conference.

I was the lead engineer for the 2010 R&D 100 Award winning Archimedes Particle Metrology System. I currently have three applications published on the Android Market.
