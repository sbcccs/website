## Introduction
I am a lecturer for the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.sbcc.edu/) at [Santa Barbara City College](http://www.sbcc.edu/) where I have worked since 2011.

## Education
I started my undergraduate work by completing the Computer Science program here at Santa Barbara City College in 2007. I continued my education at the [University of California at Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu) and received a Bachelors of Science in [Computer Engineering](http://www.ce.ucsb.edu). I realized how much I enjoyed my time there and what I was studying, so I entered the graduate program and received my Master's of Science in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu).
