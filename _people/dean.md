## Introduction
I am the current Chair of the [Computer Science Deparatment](http://cs.sbcc.edu) at [Santa Barbara City College](http://www.sbcc.edu) where I have worked since 1997 following a career in private industry. During that time I worked for organizations such as Santa Barbara Research Center (now [Raytheon](http://www.raytheon.com)), [Utilicom](http://www.beagle-ears.com/utilicom/), [NASA Dryden Flight Research Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/home/index.html), and SONY in Japan.

My favorite part about working at SBCC is working with students. The Community College system is fortunate to be able to reach all students throughout the community and this is evidenced through the classes offered by SBCC's CS Department. Our classes range from general service courses like Computer Concepts through skill building classes for community members like Javascript, DS Programming, and Wireless Device Programming.  

## Teaching Interests
My current interest is in teaching a broad variety of computer science courses. Recent courses that I have developed are:  
  
* CS 101 -  Computer Concepts (online)
* CS 111 - HTML, Web Technologies, and Webmastering
* CS 115 - JavaScript
* CS 116 - Server Side Programming
* CS 125 - C# Programming
* CS 143 - Discrete Mathematics
* CS 187 - iPhone Programming
* CS 190 - Video Game Programming
* CS 191 - DS Programming  
  
I am always looking for innovative and popular cutting edge topics which I can turn into courses for our students.  

## Research Interests
My research interests lie largely in the domain of scientific programming and computational geochemistry. I have a [list of published papers and articles](/people/dean/research) which feature several journals including [American Mineralogist](http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/AmMin/TOC/) and [Molecular Simulation](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/gmos20/current). I've also written for professional publications like [Embedded Systems Magazine](http://www.embedded.com/).
