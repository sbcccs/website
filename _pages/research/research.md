<h1>Development of a Transfer Oriented Interactive Computer Graphics Curriculum</h1>


As part of Dean Nevins' sabbatical leave report, research was done on what kinds of degrees and programs are offered related to video game programming in the states of [Arizona](/assets/research/dean/Arizona.pdf), [California](/assets/research/dean/California.pdf), [Oregon](/assets/research/dean/Oregon.pdf), [Nevada](/assets/research/dean/Nevada.pdf), and [Washington](/assets/research/dean/Washington.pdf). The links lead to the raw data that is used in the report. There is also a [summary page](/assets/research/dean/SummaryResults.pdf) that discusses the schools evaluated and their CS Bachelors degree distribution.
